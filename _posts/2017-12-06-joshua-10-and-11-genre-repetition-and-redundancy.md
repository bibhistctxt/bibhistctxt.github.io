In the previous post we saw how the [language of annihilation in Joshua 10 and 11]({% link _posts/2017-11-26-joshua-10-and-11-genre-and-annihilation.md %}), far from being something unexpected, was actually a common feature across ancient Near Eastern conquest accounts. This time we’re going to look at another feature we noticed [a couple of posts ago]({% link _posts/2017-11-14-joshua-10-and-11-a-closer-look.md %}): the text’s repetition and redundancy in the way it records the Israelite conquest of Canaan. We’ll see how it too is a common feature in ancient conquest accounts.

We find repetition throughout these two chapters, but to illustrate the point let’s look at Jos 10:29-38:

> Jos 10:29 Then <span style="color:orange">Joshua passed on from Makkedah, and all Israel with him</span>, to **Libnah**, and fought against Libnah. 30 The LORD gave it also and its king into the hand of Israel; and he <span style="color:blue">struck it with the edge of the sword</span>, and <span style="color:limegreen">every person in it</span>; <span style="color:mediumpurple">he left no one remaining</span> in it; and he did to its king <span style="color:red">as he had done to the king of Jericho</span>.
>
> 31 Next <span style="color:orange">Joshua passed on from Libnah, and all Israel with him</span>, to **Lachish**, and laid siege to it, and <span style="color:cyan">assaulted it</span>. The LORD gave Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he took it on the second day, and <span style="color:blue">struck it with the edge of the sword</span>, and <span style="color:limegreen">every person in it</span>, <span style="color:red">as he had done to Libnah</span>.
>
> 33 Then King Horam of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, leaving him no survivors.
>
> 34 <span style="color:orange">From Lachish Joshua passed on with all Israel</span> to **Eglon** [LXX: Adullam]; and they laid siege to it, and <span style="color:cyan">assaulted it</span>; and they took it that day, and <span style="color:blue">struck it with the edge of the sword</span>; and <span style="color:limegreen">every person in it</span> he <span style="color:brown">utterly destroyed</span> that day, <span style="color:red">as he had done to Lachish</span>.
>
> 36 Then <span style="color:orange">Joshua went up with all Israel from Eglon</span> to **Hebron**; they <span style="color:cyan">assaulted it</span>, and took it, and <span style="color:blue">struck it with the edge of the sword</span>, and its king and its towns, and <span style="color:limegreen">every person in it</span>; <span style="color:mediumpurple">he left no one remaining</span>, just <span style="color:red">as he had done to Eglon</span>, and <span style="color:brown">utterly destroyed</span> it with <span style="color:limegreen">every person in it</span>.
>
> 38 Then <span style="color:orange">Joshua, with all Israel, turned back</span> to **Debir** and <span style="color:cyan">assaulted it</span>, and he took it with its king and all its towns; they  <span style="color:blue">struck them with the edge of the sword</span>, and <span style="color:brown">utterly destroyed</span> <span style="color:limegreen">every person in it</span>; <span style="color:mediumpurple">he left no one remaining</span>; <span style="color:red">just as he had done to Hebron, and, as he had done to Libnah</span> and its king, so he did to Debir and its king.[^1]

As we mentioned a couple of posts ago, _this isn’t prose. This isn’t history writing_. The language is too stylized. It’s too formulaic.


{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/joshua-10-11_04-genre-repetition-redundancy/lachish_fosse_temple.jpg" caption="Remains of the Fosse Temple at Lachish, dated to the time of the events mentioned above in Joshua 10:31-33" %}

The formula is pretty clear and looks like this:

<span style="color:orange">JJoshua went (? from A) with All Israel to B</span>, (? laid seige to it) <span style="color:cyan">and assaulted it</span> and took it (? that day), and <span style="color:blue">struck it with the edge of the sword</span> (? it’s king) (? and its towns) and <span style="color:brown">utterly destroyed</span> <span style="color:limegreen">every person in it</span> (? <span style="color:mediumpurple">he left no one remaining</span>), <span style="color:red">just as he’d done to A</span>.

There are variations of course. Some phrases always appear (“_struck it with the edge of the sword_”), others appear most of the time (“_utterly destroyed_”), and others more rarely (“_and its king and its towns_”). The order of the phrases vary a little too. But the general formula is undeniable – the same words and phrases are repeated over and over in a very similar order.

The whole section could be made much shorter by removing the redundant phrases. Nothing would be lost; the same information would still be conveyed. So why does the repetition and redundancy remain?

It should be no surprise by now, but describing events in such formulaic ways is typical of the Ancient Conquest Account genre.

## Repetition and redundancy in comparative literature

About the Joshua passage we’re looking at Hess writes,

Such an annalistic style is well known in the recording of Hittite and Assyrian campaigns, where the overall pattern is repeated but specifics are altered according to the unique elements involved in capturing each town.[^2]

Let’s take a look at a few examples.

### Assyrian annals

On his “marble slab inscription” Shalmaneser III – the same Shalmaneser that Jehu son of Omri[^3] is depicted as paying tribute to on the Black Obelisk – recorded, amongst other things, his dealings with the Hittites. Here’s what he recorded of his activities in his 17th year on the throne:

> <span style="color:red">I crossed the Euphrates.</span>
> <span style="color:blue">I received the tribute of the kings of the land of Hatti.</span>
> <span style="color:mediumpurple">I went up to Mt. Hamanu.</span>
> <span style="color:limegreen">I cut down logs of cedar and juniper.</span>
> <span style="color:orange">I brought (them) to my city Aššur.</span>
> <span style="color:brown">On my return from the Mt. Hamanu:</span>
> <span style="color:darkgreen">I killed 63 mighty wild bulls, with horns, perfect specimens in the area of the town of Zuqarri on the opposite bank of the Euphrates River.</span>
> <span style="color:grey">I caught 4 alive with (my) hands!</span>[^4]

And in his 19th year:

> <span style="color:red">I crossed the Euphrates River</span> for the 17th time.
> <span style="color:blue">I received the tribute of the kings of the land of Hatti.</span>
> <span style="color:mediumpurple">I went up to Mt. Hamanu.</span>
> <span style="color:limegreen">I cut down logs of cedar and juniper.</span>
> <span style="color:orange">I brought (them) to my city Aššur.</span>
> <span style="color:brown">On my return from the Mt. Hamanu:</span>
> <span style="color:darkgreen">I killed 10 mighty wild bulls, with horns, perfect specimens (and) 2 calves (as hunted game) in the area of the town of Zuqarri on the opposite bank of the Euphrates River.</span>[^5]

It hardly needs to be said that this is highly stylized and formulaic language. Two different excursions described in exactly the same way, in exactly the same language. This isn’t what we expect to see in history writing, but it’s how the Assyrians recorded their conquests.

Though we could look at many other examples, this one was chosen because it illustrates the point well – it is _extremely_ repetitive and formulaic.

We could look at any of the annalistic texts of Tiglath-Pileser I, Ashur Dan II, Assur-nasirpal II, and Sennacherib and find similar highly repetitive, and redundant records of their conquests across the ancient Near East.

But, this is a blog post, not a PhD thesis, so let’s leave the Assyrians behind and move on to the Hittites.

### Hittite annals

In the late 1300’s BCE a Hittite king by name of Mursili II wrote up the “Deeds of Suppiluliuma”[^6]; his fantastically named father.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/joshua-10-11_04-genre-repetition-redundancy/deeds_of_suppiluliuma.png" caption="One of the tablets of the Deeds of Suppiluliuma" %}

Fragment 14:

> [Thus (spoke) my father] to my grandfather:
> [“Oh my lord!] Against the Arza]waean [enemy send] me!”
> [So my grandfather sent my father] against the Arzawaean enemy.
> [And when] <span style="color:brown">my father [had marched for (?)] the first [day?</span>,
> [he came? to the town of? ]-ašha.
> <span style="color:blue">[The gods] ran before [my father:]</span>
> <span style="color:red">[the sun goddess of Arinna, the storm god of Hatti, the storm
> god of the Army, and Ištar of the Battlefield</span>,
> <span style="color:mediumpurple">[(so that) my father slew the] Arzawaean [enemy].</span>
> <span style="color:green">and the enemy troops [died in] multi[tudes …</span>

Fragment 15:

> they brought word to my father below the town of [.…]:
> “The enemy who had gone forth to (the town of) Aniša, is now below (the town of) […]-išša.”
> (So) my father went against him.
> <span style="color:blue">And the gods ran before my father</span>:
> <span style="color:red">the Sun Goddess of Arinna, the Storm god of Hatti, the
> Storm god of the Army, and the Lady of the Battlefield.</span>
> <span style="color:mediumpurple">(Thus) he slew the aforementioned whole tribe</span>,
> <span style="color:green">and the enemy troops died in multitudes</span>.

Fragment 50:

> <span style="color:brown">Then he marched forth on that very day</span> [.…]
> But the enemy came in multitudes.
> But when it became light and the sun rose,
> he went.… to battle
> [and] he fought […]
> <span style="color:blue">And the gods [ran before] my father</span>:
> <span style="color:red">[The sungoddess of Ari]nna, the stormgod of Hatti, the stormgod of the Army, [the god X, the god Y], Ištar of the Battlefield and Zababa</span>,
> <span style="color:green">[(so that) the enemy troops] died in [multi]tudes</span>.

Again we find the same thing: three different conquest accounts written in a formulaic, repetitive style. That’s how the Hittites recorded their conquests.

## Conclusion

When we come back to Joshua 10:29-39 we find writing in the same style. The passage is written following the same rules as the conquest accounts of Israel’s neighbours, by following formula, tweaking for details like place names, but otherwise being very repetitive.

What does that mean? Well, it’s nothing sinister. It’s just evidence that the Israelite culture overlapped with those of her neighbours. Her conquest accounts were written in the same way as those of the Assyrians and Hittites. As such, we shouldn’t assume that we can take them at face value. We need to understand the genre before we can work out what the writers meant, and _certainly_ before we go digging for archaeological evidence to support face-value readings of the text.

In our next post we’ll take a look at the third common feature we found in Joshua 10 and 11: _hyperbole_. That should get the fundamentalists hot under the collar :)
