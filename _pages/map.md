Hereâ€™s a map containing sites of interest â€“ I hope itâ€™s of some use. Iâ€™m adding to it all the time, and I do my best to ensure that the pins are in exactly the right location â€“ if you spot a mistake please let me know ðŸ™‚

Also, if you click the broken square icon in the top right the map will open full screen in a new tab and will be actually usable.
