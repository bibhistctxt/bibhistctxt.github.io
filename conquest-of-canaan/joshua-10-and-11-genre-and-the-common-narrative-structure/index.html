<p>When we took <a href="/conquest-of-canaan/joshua-10-and-11-a-closer-look/">a closer look at Joshua 10 and 11</a> one of the things we found was that they follow a similar sequence. It‚Äôs as if they‚Äôre employ some sort of formula we‚Äôre not aware of. In this post we‚Äôll dig into the background to this common narrative structure.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs start by doing what we did previously but this time in more detail. We‚Äôll lay the two chapters next to each other to make the common narrative structure apparent:</p>

<p>Hopefully the table makes the common pattern obvious. With a couple of exceptions (in <span style="color:lightgrey">grey</span>), the order of events in the two chapters is practically identical.</p>

<p>So, why are the sequence of events of two completely different campaigns the same?</p>

<h2 id="amazing-coincidence-or-formula">Amazing coincidence? Or formula?</h2>

<p>There are two options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>By some amazing coincidence both campaigns happened to occur in a pretty much identical sequence</li>
  <li>The the sequence followed by both chapters follows some sort of a formula</li>
</ul>

<p>The first option can be readily dismissed for a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The causes of the battles were different</li>
  <li>The enemies were different</li>
  <li>The terrain was different</li>
  <li>Both accounts are filled with <a href="/conquest-of-canaan/joshua-10-and-11-genre-and-hyperbole/">hyperbole</a></li>
  <li>The archaeological evidence is firmly against the historicity of either campaign</li>
</ul>

<p>What about the second option, i.e. that the two conquest accounts follow a formula?</p>

<p>Well, as we‚Äôve previously seen, some parts of <a href="/conquest-of-canaan/joshua-10-and-11-genre-repetition-and-redundancy/">Joshua 10 and 11 are stylized, repetitive, and contain much redundant text</a>. The example we looked at was this:</p>

<p><span style="color:orange">Joshua went (? from A) with All Israel to B</span>, (? laid seige to it) <span style="color:cyan">and assaulted it</span> and took it (? that day), and <span style="color:blue">struck it with the edge of the sword</span> (? it‚Äôs king) (? and its towns) and <span style="color:brown">utterly destroyed</span> <span style="color:limegreen">every person in it</span> (? <span style="color:mediumpurple">he left no one remaining</span>), <span style="color:red">just as he‚Äôd done to A</span>.</p>

<p>Those verses <em>already</em> follow a formula. It‚Äôs already <em>a done deal that the chapters contain fomulaic language</em>. And, what turns out to be true in the details of <em>verses</em> is also true when we zoom out. Just as many of the <em>verses</em> follow a common structure and are therefore practically identical varying only on what town was being annihilated, the two <em>chapters</em> also follow a common narrative structure and only really vary in the details of enemy and location.</p>

<p>Do we find this sort of thing elsewhere? Yes we do. And plenty of it. Let‚Äôs take a look at one example.</p>

<h2 id="the-deeds-of-tiglath-pileser-i">The Deeds of Tiglath-Pileser I</h2>

<p>Just like what we see in Joshua 10 and 11, the Deeds of Tiglath-Pileser I have two conquest accounts that look very similar, with a few variations. This isn‚Äôt an isolated phenomenon ‚Äì most of the other conquest accounts on the same prism conform to some common narrative structure, e.g. Episodes 4 and 7 also share a formula, though one a little different to that followed by episodes 9 and 19.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> The Deeds of Tiglath-Pileser I aren‚Äôt an anomaly; common narrative structures can be seen in Assyrian, Hittite, and Egyptian conquest accounts.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>What was the purpose of these conquest accounts? It certainly wasn‚Äôt to narrate the events surrounding campaigns as a series of facts. As Younger explains of the Assyrian accounts,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúThe monotonous iteration of the typical syntagms instilled in the ancient public a sense of forced anticipation of the obvious outcome of the event itself; and hence, of the relentless efficacy of the action of the Assyrian king‚Ä¶ The use of syntagmic patterning in the narration of each campaign‚Ä¶ reflects the Assyrian concept of a <strong>girru</strong> (campaign). The real sense of a campaign is to be found in its desire for the restoration of order. The enemy has brought about disorder and chaos, and the Assyrian king must reinstate order, righteousness and life. The decisive moment, therefore, is‚Ä¶ the submission of all the surrounding minor political centers to the Assyrian king.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The aim of these ancient conquest accounts and their common narrative structure wasn‚Äôt to explain what happened; it was to communicate via predictable and repetitive structures the inevitable victory of the divinely-approved conquerer against any foe. Any challenge to his power would be systematically and thoroughly squashed. There was no differentiation between enemies ‚Äì they‚Äôd all be defeated.</p>

<p>Conquest accounts were not so much <em>history</em> as they were a threat to potential enemies, and a means to confirm in the minds of the ruler‚Äôs subjects that he was the divinely-appointed and all-powerful ruler.</p>

<p>Ancient conquest accounts were <em>propaganda</em>; the <em>medium was the message</em>. As Younger explains elsewhere,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This iterative scheme is not ornamental. It is an important literary convention for communicative purposes.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does this mean for Joshua 10 and 11? Are they spun out of whole cloth? Are they entirely made up just to scare potential enemies out of attacking the Israelites?</p>

<h2 id="telescoping">Telescoping</h2>

<p>Just because these accounts follow a formula doesn‚Äôt meant that they are of no historical value whatsoever. Younger makes this point at the end of his ‚ÄúAncient Conquest Accounts‚Äù:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We do not wish to give the reader the impression that we believe that none of the data in the ancient texts is trustworthy or that all is rhetoric and stereotyped vocabulary. It is simply that the use of a common transmission code underlying the ancient texts must be taken into account; the commonality of such set language does not negate the fact that a war took place, that someone won or that the army performed certain specific actions.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After all, the description of the destruction of Hazor in Jos 11:10-11 matches the archaeological evidence of its destruction very closely.<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> However, the archaeological evidence for the destruction of other Canaanite towns is that they came to their end anywhere between 25 to 100 years after Hazor was burned.<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

<p>How does this relate to the conquest accounts? Ancient Near Eastern conquest accounts are <em>telescoped</em>; a concept Malamat explains as being,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Äú‚Ä¶the compression of a string of events into a unified narrative of a relatively brief time-span. Long, involved campaigns were chronologically foreshortened by late redactors, thereby creating in retrospect a historical account of artificial simplicity.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I.e. records of battles/skirmishes that took place over many years were massaged into a single campaign, exaggerated beyond recognition, and made to follow a common narrative structure.</p>

<p>Joshua 10 and 11 fit the bill very well: they follow a common narrative structure, and they mention the destruction of towns that archaeological evidence tells us were taken or destroyed over the space of around 200 years.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>What does this mean for our chapters? Well, they clearly were <em>never intended</em> to be plain historical records, and to read them as such is to miss the purpose of their author. Though they contain kernels of historicity they are ancient Near Eastern conquest accounts and were written for the same reason as other conquest accounts were written: <em>they‚Äôre propaganda</em>.</p>

<p>Next time we‚Äôll take a look at the final feature in our list: Joshua 10 and 11‚Äôs focus on Joshua.</p>
